**`Pentester & Security Researcher`**

I'm currently working for a company called EXATEL, where I'm involved in penetration testing of LANs (mainly Active Directory) and web applications. I started my career in security already in high school, where I passed my first two Microsoft certifications, which then helped me get my first job as a Junior Penetration Tester.
